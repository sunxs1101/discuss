5.1.2. New Hard Drives Names<br><br>Now all the rotating hard drives uses the same names as the old SCSI controllers,

on the Mother Board or the extended boards. Usually 4 are available. What will be the number of a drive is up to the controller 
card and the way it's read by the kernel, so difficult to say at first.
